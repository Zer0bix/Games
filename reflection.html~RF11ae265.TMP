                <span class="description">For this task, we were asked to create a website with a specific theme. The theme I chose was a game development website. The website required knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript, and so as I was creating the website, I was also learning the functions of various tags, functions and stylisations. This was mainly done through searching on the Internet, "How do I do this", and then reading all the things it suggested and combining them together for what I wanted.</span>
                <br><br>
                <span class="description">I planned the website primarily within <a href="trello.com" class="cursor_hand" style="color:rgba(255, 150, 150, 0.8); font-size:15px;">trello</a>, using a different board for each page on the site. The website was created in a slightly chaotic fashion, where I would decide to work on a specific feature, and while working on that feature I would improve other features that I noticed were lacking.</span>
                <br><br>
                <span class="description">The main drawback to creating a game website was that I needed to create a game. While this was highly enjoyable, the amount and difficulty of coding the necessary javascript significantly lengthened the time that it would take to create the first project. For example, the saving functionality of Wooden Empire took up a span of 46 days (not all the days were worked on, but a good number were). This led to only a few weeks being devoted to a decent proportion of the task (all the other pages), meaning they lacked in quality.</span>
                <br><br>
                <span class="description">I decided to use a dark colour scheme for the website, as my website is aimed at people used to surfing the internet, and the game is likely to be played at night (or in a classroom where a bright page would be more easily noticeable as not-work)</span>
                <br><br>
                <span class="label">Things I would do differently:</span>
                <br>
                <span class="description"><span class="label">1.</span>Have a full plan ready from prior to the assessment</span>
                <br>
                <span class="description"><span class="label">2.</span>Wait to implement a saving mechanic until the end of the project.</span>
                <br>
                <span class="description"><span class="label">3.</span>Begin work on the non-game website first, leaving the fun website for last.</span>
                <br>
                <span class="description"><span class="label">4.</span>Spend more time on the main tab of the game, making the clicker better with an image.</span>

# Games website and pages for Zer0bi Games
My Games website with Wooden_Empire and some other services.
Also contains all the files for my Year 10 Term 3 IST assessment.
As of 02/09/2023, all content is created by myself (such as images, bits of code etc.)

Images created with: https://www.piskelapp.com/p/create/sprite

Wooden_Empire is partially inspired by:
NG space company (https://ngspacecompany.freddecgames.com/)
(mainly the concept of buildings and research).
